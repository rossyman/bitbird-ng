# Bitbird x Angular (↑%)

A vibrant new bitbird website wrote with Angular, not WordPress ✨

Thanks for checking out this repo! ❤️ This repository of work is in no way intended to represent an official change in bitbird's website; rather it was intended to showcase the flexibility of using a single-page-application framework, over a server-side based framework like WordPress.

### Technical Information

There's currently no-backend supporting the REST calls made by the SPA, rather I've added in a fake-backend interceptor to highlight what could be possible if we were to connect the SPA to an application using something such as Spring, to manage our API calls, which would, in turn, allow us to develop an administration/content management portal.

The website was wrote using TypeScript 3.9, Angular 10 and a whole host of other libraries for testing. GitHub Actions was used as part of the CI process to ensure code-hygiene, utilising Angular's built in testing and linting tools.
